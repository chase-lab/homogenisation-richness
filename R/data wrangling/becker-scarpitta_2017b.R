Methods: 'Using identical methods for the two time periods, theabundance of all species of vascular plant (herbaceous species, ferns, shrubs and trees) and bryophytes (Bryophyta and Marchantiophyta) were recorded following a phytosociological approach (Bardat 1978). In each plot (400 m2) or subplot (see below), the abundance of all vascular plant and bryophyte species present in the plot was recorded using Braun-Blanquetâ€™s phytosociological coefficient[...]For vascular plants, the recent surveys were conducted in 2009 during two time windows in April for spring flowering species and in June/July for summer flowering species' Effort is the total number of plots."
