variable name	definition
dataset_id	"Unique ID linked to a publication (article or data set). If the data set was split because different taxa group are provided, a letter is added at the end. No missing values."
year	"Year of sampling. If sampling was pooled over several years, the last sampling year is used here. No missing values."
regional	"Region name, contains at least two localities. Can be a national park, a state or a forest name for example but smaller scales are also included where the region is an experimental sites. A data set can have several regions. No missing values."
local	"Name or code of the sampled locality or experimental sample. For example, it can correspond to the name of an island, a lake or forest. No missing values."
latitude	"Latitude North in decimal degree, WGS84. No missing values."
longitude	"Longitude East in Decimal degree, WGS84. No missing values."
effort	Effort is the number of sites in the region/the number of sites used to compute the mean local taxonomic richness. No missing values.
study_type	"One of ""resurvey""or ""ecological sampling"". RESURVEY: typically two samplings separated by a long, 20+ years, stretch of time and a great deal of effort is put in matching very precisely historical plots or transects. ECOLOGICAL SAMPLING: these studies generally involve more samplings than resurveys: 10 samplings, 1 every few years. No missing values."
data_pooled_by_authors	TRUE if the data provided by the authors was already pooled covering several years: several samples made over several years pooled together. If FALSE, data was provided by year and no pooling was needed. No missing values.
data_pooled_by_authors_comment	"If there was pooling by the original authors, countains free text describing how the authors pooled their data. ""NA"" value in the absence of pooling by the authors."
sampling_years	"If there was pooling by the original authors, countains the years sampled for each period. ""1997, 1999"" means 1997 and 1999, ""1997-1999"" means 1997, 1998 and 1999. Empty cells indicate that information could not be collected."
alpha_grain_m2	Area of the local unit or area of the sampling gear (alpha_grain_type = sample). Empty cells indicate that information could not be collected.
alpha_grain_type	"Category of alpha_grain, one of: sample, plot or lake_pond. Empty cells indicate that information could not be collected."
alpha_grain_comment	Description of the alpha_grain measure. No missing values.
gamma_bounding_box_km2	"Measure of the extent/regional scale area as the area covering all sites, computed as a convex-hull or a rectangle box or as the area of the administrative unit in which sites are found. No missing values."
gamma_bounding_box_type	"Category of gamma_bounding_box, one of: ""administrative"" (eg the area of a park or state), ""island"", ""functional"", ""box"" (a box covering the sites) or ""catchment"". No missing values."
gamma_bounding_box_comment	Description of the gamma_bounding_box value, area of the region given in the original article for instance. No missing values.
gamma_sum_grains_km2	Measure of the extent/regional scale area as the sum of the grains sampled each year. Empty cells indicate that information could not be collected.
gamma_sum_grains_type	"Category of gamma_sum_grains, one of: ""plot"", ""sample"" or ""lake_pond"". Empty cells indicate that information could not be collected."
gamma_sum_grains_comment	Description the gamma_sum_grains value, island area found in a database of area of the plot found in the original article for instance. NA values indicate that additional information was not needed or that it could not be collected.
realm	"Realm in which the sampling was done, one of: Freshwater or Terrestrial. No missing values."
taxon	"Taxon group of the data set, one of: ""Plants"", ""Invertebrates"" or ""Fish"". No missing values."
comment	"A description of the data set origin, goal and sampling method. No missing values."
comment_standardisation	"A short description of the modifications we made to the data set to ensure standard effort: excluded sites or years, excluded taxa, etc. ""NA"" in the absence of standardisation."
