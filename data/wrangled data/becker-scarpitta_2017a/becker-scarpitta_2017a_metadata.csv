Methods: 'Using identical methods for the two time periods, theabundance of all species of vascular plant (herbaceous species, ferns, shrubs and trees) and bryophytes (Bryophyta and Marchantiophyta) were recorded following a phytosociological approach (Bardat 1978).

Not all substrates were present in a given plot, so the total number of subplots (93: 44 soil + 2 rock + 32 stump +  15 branch) is <46 x4, but identical for the two time periods (balanced design). Because there are only two subplots of rock per year, we removed these from analyses, leaving 91 subplots per year.' Effort is the total number of subplots."
