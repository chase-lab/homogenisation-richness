variable name	necessary	definition
dataset_id	TRUE	Unique ID linked to a publication (article or data set). If the data set was split because different taxa group are provided, a letter is added at the end.
year	TRUE	Year of sampling
regional	TRUE	Region name. Can be a national park, a state or a forest name for example. A data set can have several regions.
local	TRUE	Island, lake, forest name
latitude	TRUE	Decimal degree, WGS84
longitude	TRUE	Decimal degree, WGS84
effort	FALSE	Effort is the number of sites in the region/the number of sites used to compute the mean local taxonomic richness.
study_type	TRUE	One of "resurvey"or "ecological sampling". RESURVEY: typically two samplings separated by a long, 20+ years, stretch of time and a great deal of effort is put in matching very precisely historical plots or transects. ECOLOGICAL SAMPLING: these studies generally involve more samplings than resurveys: 10 samplings, 1 every few years.
data_pooled_by_authors	TRUE	TRUE if the data provided by the authors was already pooled covering several years: several samples made over several years pooled together
data_pooled_by_authors_comment	FALSE	If there was pooling by the original authors: free text describing how the authors pooled data
sampling_years	FALSE	If there was pooling by the original authors: years sampled for each period. "1997, 1999" means 1997 and 1999, "1997-1999" means 1997, 1998 and 1999
alpha_grain	TRUE	Area of the local unit or area of the sampling gear (alpha_grain_type = sample)
alpha_grain_unit	TRUE	Unit of the area recorded in alpha_grain
alpha_grain_type	TRUE	Category of alpha_grain, one of: sample, plot or lake_pond
alpha_grain_comment	TRUE	Description of the alpha_grain measure
gamma_bounding_box	TRUE	Measure of the extent/regional scale area as the area covering all sites, computed as a convex-hull or a rectangle box or as the area of the administrative unit in which sites are found.
gamma_bounding_box_unit	TRUE	Unit in which the gamma_bounding_box area is expressed
gamma_bounding_box_type	TRUE	Category of gamma_bounding_box, one of: "administrative", "island", "functional", "box" or "catchment".
gamma_bounding_box_comment	TRUE	Description or source of the gamma_bounding_box value
gamma_sum_grains	TRUE	Measure of the extent/regional scale area as the sum of the grains sampled each year.
gamma_sum_grains_unit	TRUE	Unit in which the gamma_sum_grains area is expressed
gamma_sum_grains_type	TRUE	Category of gamma_sum_grains, one of: "plot", "sample" or "lake_pond"
gamma_sum_grains_comment	TRUE	Description or source of the gamma_sum_grains value
realm	TRUE	Realm in which the sampling was done, one of: Freshwater or Terrestrial
taxon	TRUE	Taxon group of the data set, one of: "Plants", "Invertebrates" or "Fish" 
comment	TRUE	A description of the data set origin, goal and sampling method.
