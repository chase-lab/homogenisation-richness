variable name	necessary	definition
dataset_id	TRUE	NA
year	TRUE	NA
regional	TRUE	archipelago name
local	TRUE	"island, lake, forest name"
latitude	TRUE	decimal degree, WGS84
longitude	TRUE	decimal degree, WGS84
effort	FALSE	NA
checklist	FALSE	NA
study_type	TRUE	one of "resurvey", "checklist" or "ecological sampling". A checklist has no well defined effort, it can be specialists lising all encountered species over an area or researchers aggregating species composition from the literature, museum collections, etc. RESURVEY: typically two samplings separated by a long, 20+ years, stretch of time and a great deal of effort is put in matching very precisely historical plots or transects. ECOLOGICAL SAMPLING: these studies generally involve more samplings than resurveys: 10 samplings, 1 every few years.
data_pooled_by_authors	TRUE	TRUE if the data provided by the authors was already pooled covering several years: several samples made over several years pooled together
data_pooled_by_authors_comment	FALSE	if there was pooling by the original authors: free text describing how the authors pooled data
sampling_years	FALSE	if there was pooling by the original authors: years sampled for each period. "1997, 1999" means 1997 and 1999, "1997-1999" means 1997, 1998 and 1999
